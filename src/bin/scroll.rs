/**
 * Scroll
 *
 * While wandering through a forest, FatalEagle comes across a «Scroll». He's not too sure about the meaning of the contents
 * of the «Scroll», just like he has his doubts about the content of this problem.
 *
 * Input Specification
 * A single integer, N ( 0 ≤ N ≤ 100 ) . Just kidding, no input.
 *
 * Output Specification
 * Who knows? Does it matter to you that much?
 *
 * Sample Input
 * It might exist, but it probably doesn't.
 *
 * Sample Output
 * Can sample output exist without sample input? If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a
 * sound? Is the previous question even relevant?
