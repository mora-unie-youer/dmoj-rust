 * In this task, you must print out the message Hello, World! â€” the judge is very strict, so you must output it with the same
 * capitalization and punctuation.
 *
 * Some example solutions in a couple of languages are shown below. After you've gotten the hang of submitting, try out a
 * harder problem like A Plus B.
